# Project Trash Printer
There is a lot of plastic waste and it is rarely utilised after it is disposed. We think that if we could create a machine capable of being fed the ground up plastic waste and print with it, we will be able to find a solution to the growing amount of trash. The goal of this project is to create a modular and open sourced design for a pellet extruder for integration into the Gigabot platform. This project has already taken on multiple revisions before ever starting physical construction.
